Brief Summary of the project:

Throughout their service life, HVAC filters not only clean the air we breathe by capturing harmful airborne particles, but they also collect a sample of these indoor particles. Consequently, these filters are both fascinating and valuable for experts in Indoor Air Quality (IAQ), Indoor Environmental Engineering, and Health sectors, as they provide insights into the particles and particle-bound contaminants we may inhale. Once their service life is over in HVAC systems, these filters can be collected, and the dust accumulated on them, that is formed by the graduatl collection of indoor air particles, can be analyzed to investigate airborne particle-bound contaminants.

The analysis of dust particles on HVAC filters is known as Filter Forensics. By combining Filter Forensics data with metadata from HVAC systems, such as airflow rate, system runtime, and HVAC filter efficiency, it becomes possible to calculate the long-term concentration of airborne particles and particle-bound contaminants. This concentration caclulation is pretty much useful for exposure assessments of chronic diseasesm and this technique is referred to as Quantitative Filter Forensics (QFF).

The extraction of dust from residential HVAC filters plays a crucial role in QFF. A good dust recovery and recovery efficiency can significantly improve the accuracy of QFF estimations. Therefore, it is essential to study the extraction process of dust from these filters. Data mining of HVAC filter dust extraction allows us to draw sufficient insights to support better estimation of IAQ and the health effects of harmful particle-bound contaminants.

In this repository, I will present all the data pipelines, data pre-processing codes, statistical models, descriptive statistics, and plot visualizations related to Phase 1 of Mahdavi &amp; Siegel (2020) (AS&ampT) paper. While most of the front-end results have been discussed in the accompanying paper, what you will find here are the underlying codes that generate the results and discussions presented in the paper.
